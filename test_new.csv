An extended color Petri net, the control and integration net (CIN), is proposed. This CIN is used to build the execution kernel for the CIMOSA model. The system architecture is given. The execution system's computational view is also presented. The CIMOSA model execution system presented here is under implementation in a production system at the Berlin Fraunhofer Institute of Production Systems and Design Technology. The system's layout and relevant components are introduced. The proposed CIN method provides a new approach for CIM system integration.

It is also involved in defense reactions and is related with immunities in insects. PPO, a metalloenzyme oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of o-diphenol to o-quinone. The present paper describes the effects of benzaldehyde and its p-substituted derivatives on the activity of PPO from the fifth instar of Pieris rapae L. PPO from the fifth instar of Pieris rapae L. was purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on Sephadex G-100. The enzyme kinetics was characterized using L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as substrate. The results show that benzaldehyde, p­ hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-chlorobenzaldehyde, and p-cyanobenzaldehyde can inhibit the PPO activity for the oxidation of L-DOPA. The inhibitor concentration leading to 500/0 activity lost, IC 50 , was estimated to be 5.90, 5.62, 2.83, and 2.91 mmol/L for the four tested inhibitors, respectively. Kinetic analyses show that the inhibitory effects of these compounds are reversible. Benzaldehyde, p­ hydroxybenzaldehyde, and p-chlorobenzaldehyde are noncompetitive inhibitors while p-cyano­ benzaldehyde is a mixed-type inhibitor. The inhibition constants were determined for all four inhibitors. p-chlorobenzaldehyde and p-cyanobenzaldehyde were more potent inhibitors than the other compounds.

An increase in osmotic pressure caused by the addition of sucrose inhibits the vacuolation and shrinkage of cytoplasm in the cells. As the sucrose concentration increases, the total amount of accumulated biomass also increases. Besides the sucrose concentration, increased ionic strength and inoculation ratio also help restrain to a large extent the vacuolation and shrinkage of the cytoplasm in the suspended cells, which results in increased biomass.

This methodology enables materials synthesis at extraordinarily low temperatures that are compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing/selective growth and provides the means for obtaining highly metastable strain states in prototype structures that cannot be obtained by conventional protocols. Some of the materials and devices under development, involving alloys in the Si-Ge-Sn system, open up exciting opportunities in photodetectors and photovoltaics because they grow directly on cheap Si substrates and cover an extended range of the near-infrared spectrum that is not accessible to current photovoltaic and optoelectronic group IV semiconductors.

The evidence for the natural bioremediation of benzene from the groundwater included: (1) analysis of groundwater chemistry, (2) laboratory studies demonstrating benzene biodegradation in aquifer samples, and (3) computer simulations examining benzene transport. Laboratory experiments indicated that for conditions similar to those in the plume, the aerobic degradation of benzene by the naturally occurring microorganisms in the polluted groundwater samples was quite rapid with a half-life time of from 5 to 15 days. In situ analyses indicated the level of dissolved oxygen in the groundwater was over 2 mg/L. Thus, oxygen should not limit the biodegradation. In fact, the benzene was also shown to degrade under anaerobic conditions. The results from the modeling simulations indicate that biodegradation is the dominant process influencing attenuation of the benzene.",,,,,

"""Human""","Heavy metal micro-contaminants can be removed from water sources such as rivers and lakes using variations of conventional treatment technologies. Weakly basic anion exchange resins offer the best ability to remove trace amounts of heavy metals with high selectivity. This paper discusses how weakly basic resins adsorb heavy metals using two different approaches. The removal of mercury, cadmium, and lead ions is based on the fundamental theory of coordination chemistry. The mechanism is not ion exchange but extractive adsorption of heavy metal salts. However, the marked preferential adsorption of chromate by weakly basic anion exchange can be explained using the traditional theory of ion exchange. A lab-scale study produced positive results for the removal of trace amounts of heavy metal ions from drinking water.

Ways to measure the extent of interdiffusion and mathematical equations for predicting these measures are given. The equations are based on the error function solution to the diffusion equation and do not take into account variations of the diffusivity with composition. Also, when the substrate of the coating is multiphase, the equations do not take into account the precipitate morphology, but do take into account that precipitates can act as sinks or sources of solute as the average composition of the substrate varies. The equations are meant to be alloy design tools that indicate how changing substrate or coating chemistry will reduce the extent of interdiffusion.

The analysis incorporates the nucleation and growth processes associated with the eutectic transformation. The CT is related to the physicochemical state of the liquid, the eutectic cells in the flake graphite, and the number of nodules in nodular cast iron. In particular, the CT can be related to the critical wall thickness, s cr , or the chill width, W cr , in wedge shaped castings. Finally, this work serves as a guide for understanding the effect of technical factors such as the melt chemistry, the spheroidizing and inoculation practice, and the holding time and temperature on the resultant CT and chill of the cast iron.
